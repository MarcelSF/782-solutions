# 3 -> Ask the user what they want to buy -> Ask the user to type out what they want (kiwi, apple, etc)
# 4 -> Check to see if the desired item is available in the store
# 5 -> If it is available: Add the item to the cart

# item -> hash

# we need to access the hash to get the information.
# call the hash and give it the key -> it will return to us the value
  # 8 -> Show the bill to the user
